# Dynamic Typing in Python:

a = "Hello"     # String is stored in variable a of type <str>
print(type(a))
# if we again initialize this variable to any integer value than the variable type will get converted to <int>
# This is Dynamic Typing in Python.
a = 5;
print(type(a))

# We can dynamically change the data type of any variable like this.
